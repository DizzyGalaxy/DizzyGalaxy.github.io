            <p>Ever since I was young, I've always been fascinated by video games, especially Pokemon. When I discovered a simple yet wonderful game engine called "Scratch", making games on it had quickly become my hobby. I started to appreciate all the hard work that went into my favorite video games. Creating a video game is very hard, but I'm going to pursue this dream of mine. Now I am working hard on my newest video game.</p>
            <p>In order to make video games, there are three important components that go into the making of a video game. Code, art and music. First, you need to pick a game engine. Whether it's Scratch, Unity, Godot or even Roblox Studio, it's up to you. Next, you need to learn the programming language that your game engine needs to function. There are lots of tutorials about that topic. Then, you'll need to draw some art or "borrow" some art. Having art in your game will give your game a huge glow up. There are different types of art styles, vector or 2D art. It's up to you again. And finally music. Music and sound effects will make your game much less boring. Music is the hardest part for me, so I usually just "borrow" some music and sound effects that I find online.</p>

            <h3>Recommended Tools</h3>

            <h4>For kids</h4>


            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>
            <p>Scratch provides blocks for coding and an easy-to-use interface. You can explore millions of projects made by people around the globe. It is ideal for any kids who is just starting to code.</p>
            
            <a href="https://www.scratchjr.org/">Scratch Jr.</a>
            <p>If you want something even easier, try Scratch Jr. Scratch Jr. is made for even younger children. It is more limited than Scratch.</p>
            
            <a href="https://arcade.makecode.com/">Makecode Arcade</a>
            <p>Makecode Arcade lets you make retro games. I would say that it is harder than Scratch. Makecode Arcade's main  art style is pixel art. Despite the limited color palette of only 16 colors, I'm sure you'll enjoy drawing in this game engine.</p>
            
            <p>All of these game engines has an built-in art software so you don't need to draw outside the game engines.</p>
            <a href="https://create.roblox.com/">Roblox Studio</a>
            
            <p>Did you know that Roblox is a game engine too? Roblox Studio is a 3D game engine and way more advanced than the other 3 above. Roblox Studio uses text-based coding and operates on a programming language called Lua. Although learning it will be hard, you can share your games to your friends and have a fun time playing. There are lots of resources for learning this game engine.</p>
